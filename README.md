### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Gabriela Mattos. I am a technician in Industrial Automation by CEFET (Federal Center for Technological Education) and a student of Computer Science at UFRJ. I currently work voluntarily at EJCM (Computer Company at UFRJ) as a frontend developer. I like to go deeper and deeper in frontend development but I am also very interested in UX/UI area. In my free time I like to read books of romance and fiction, watch movies, series and spend time with my family and friends.
